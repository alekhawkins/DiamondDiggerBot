Download XNA Redistributable here: https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/confirmation.aspx?id=23714

If adding a reference, my dll was located here:
C:\Windows\Microsoft.NET\assembly\GAC_32\Microsoft.Xna.Framework\v4.0_4.0.0.0__842cf8be1de50553\Microsoft.Xna.Framework.dll

If you add images you want to use as textures, make sure to set "Copy to Output Directory" -> "Copy Always"
